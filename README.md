# Software-Engineering-Project
This repository contains the final project for our Software Engineering class.
Our team developed a mobile application that implements Machine Learning for food classification based on the NOVA system.

The app allows users to take a photo of a food package label, and the model will classify the product into one of the following categories:
- NOVA 1 → Unprocessed foods
- NOVA 2 → Processed culinary ingredients
- NOVA 3 → Processed foods
- NOVA 4 → Ultra-processed foods

The goal of this project is to help users easily identify whether a food product is ultra-processed or not, making it simpler to understand nutritional quality based on packaging labels.
